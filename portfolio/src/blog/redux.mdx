# How Redux Can Make You a Better Developer

When React came out I was really amazed with its easiness of use and learning curve.
When I first started learning React I wasn’t aware of the fact that React is just a library and not a fully fledged framework.
I wasn’t aware that I would need to make all decisions about architecture and what exactly I would need to use in order to solve some common tasks.
Other frameworks would give you solutions and architecture out of the box which is not the case with React lib.
Yes, someone might say that I was naive and dumb but that naivety and my will to learn new things pushed me forward and made me a better developer and decision maker.

Everyone who enters the world of React will need to make those decisions in some point of time, no matter how small (HTTP client, routing, build tools and many more) or big they are (state management, architecture…).
One particular decision that we almost always have to make when we’re starting with the development of an application is how to handle state in application.
Choosing the best way to handle state is inevitable.
The thing with JavaScript is that there is a double-digit number of potential solutions — which can be a good thing (you have plenty of options to choose from) or a bad thing (too many options can be really daunting and researching all of them takes up your precious time).

We are still in the chaotic phase of shifting paradigms in the frontend world, therefore new libraries for state management are emerging every day.
In all this chaos one solution blazed out — enter Redux.
