_How are you?_
Or should I say - _Wie geht es dir?_ 🇩🇪
Or maybe - _Kako si?_ 🇭🇷

I hope you are doing well and that you are ready to develop a website that supports multiple languages. Internationalization, or shortly i18n, is the process of designing a software that can be adapted to different language without engineering changes.

In this article, we will go through the basic i18n setup with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and headless CMS.
We will support three languages:

- English (default)
- German and
- Croatian

This setup is extendable to any number of languages and will work with any kind of headless CMS that you choose with some minor tweaks in the code.
Here we will use [Prismic CMS](https://prismic.io).

For setting up i18n on our website we will divide configuration into two parts:

- **Internationalization routing** and content that will be changed often by content editors
- **Component internationalization** for the content inside components that won't be changed that often by content editors

## Internationalization routing
